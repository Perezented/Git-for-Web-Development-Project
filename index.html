        Stretch Questions


        1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?


        inline will only take up the necessary space needed, block will take up the whole width of a screen.

        2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?

        3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a
        width?

        in css

        display: inline-block;

        4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element
        that is display inline-block by default

        block: div, figure, section;

        inline:span, img https://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html_blocks.asp

        inline-block: button, apparently also img http://w3c.github.io/html-reference/img.html#img-display

        5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?

        Unsure on what kind of fix or the fix for the box model. it has margin, border, padding, content, from outer
        layer to inner layer.
